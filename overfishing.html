            Billions of people around the world rely on fish as a source of protein and fishing is the principal livelihood of millions. Maintaining the balance of exquisite life in our oceans is just as critical to life on land.
          </p>
          <p>
            But many of the world's fisheries have been pushed beyond their biological limits. Some are even at the point of collapse. Overfishing is a major problem globally, due largely to poor fisheries management and Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing.
          </p>

          <h1>Impacts</h1>

          <p>
            A new WWF(worldwide wildlife fund) analysis indicates that 85% of global fish stocks are at risk from IUU fishing, representing 10-31% of the world's catch, valued at $10-23.5 billion annually. This poses a threat to the sustainability of targeted species and the marine food web, endangers legal fishing, impacting coastal community well-being and global seafood security. The fishing fleet exceeds sustainable ocean capacity by 2.5 times, exceeding natural fish reproduction and leading to overfishing. Consequently, 24% of species are overexploited or recovering, 52% of fisheries are fully exploited, and key commercial species are endangered.
