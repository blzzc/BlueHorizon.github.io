          <h1>Marine noise pollution</h1>
          <div class="centered-text">
            <div>
          <p>
            Many marine animals are highly dependent on underwater sound. Visibility is often low but sound is transmitted extremely well through water. As a result, it has evolved as an important sensory signal for marine wildlife, particularly for marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises. They rely on sound to communicate, locate mates and prey, avoid predators, navigate, and even defend their territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, over the past few decades, noise pollution in the marine environment has increased dramatically and is threatening the natural soundscape of the marine environment. Ships, seismic surveys, explosions, construction, and sonar devices have made the once peaceful environment into a loud, chaotic home which is extremely damaging for marine wildlife. This type of pollution is often overlooked in comparison to others but its impacts are now being documented across all types of marine ecosystems.

          <h1>The Ripple Effect</h1>
          <p>
            As our maritime adventures continue, we come face to face with the profound impact of ship-generated noise on marine ecosystems. The relentless hum of ship engines, propellers, and sonar systems can interfere with the communication and navigation abilities of marine species, particularly those reliant on sound for survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            For cetaceans like whales and dolphins, whose intricate vocalisations are essential for mating, hunting, and maintaining social bonds, the cacophony of ship noise becomes a disruptive force. It can lead to communication breakdowns, increased stress levels, and even changes in migration patterns, affecting the delicate balance of life beneath the surface.
